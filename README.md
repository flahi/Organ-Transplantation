# Organ Transplantation Management

This project implements a blockchain-based organ transplantation management system that leverages PLONK Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for privacy and security. PLONK (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge) is a cutting-edge ZKP protocol, ideal for verifying computations without exposing sensitive data. The project aims to create a transparent, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for managing and matching organ donors and recipients on the blockchain.
